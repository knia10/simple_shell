## _Description_ ‚≠ê

In this project we try to replicate a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line. Which can operate both an interactive and a non-interactive mode. 

## _C Language standard functions and system calls utilized_ üå™
`access`, `execve`, `exit`, `fork`, `getcwd`, `isatty`, `malloc`,`read`, `write`, `signal`, `wait`.
 
## _Brief synopsis_

All files in this repository are designed to compile with GNU compiler in the Linux environment from  _Ubuntu 20.04 LTS_. When compiled, the executable program replicates a "shell" or command line interpreter, which is a user interface used for access to an operating system's services. This shell has a set of custom built-in commands, and also integrates with other commands located in the system's PATH. Output and functionality from commands is designed to replicate output from the shell and other commands.
